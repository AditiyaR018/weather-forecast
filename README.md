🌦️ Mini Project: Weather App using APIs

In this mini project, I learned how to work with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of the project was to build a simple yet functional Weather Application that fetches real-time weather data from an external API and displays it to the user in a clean and user-friendly interface.

🔑 Key Features

Real-time Weather Data: Users can enter a city name to retrieve current weather information.

Temperature Display: Shows the current temperature in degrees Celsius.

Humidity Level: Displays the current humidity percentage of the selected location.

Wind Speed: Fetches and displays the wind speed in km/h.

Expandable Information: The app can be extended to include more data such as pressure, sunrise/sunset times, visibility, and weather conditions (e.g., cloudy, sunny).

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the content on the webpage.

CSS: For designing and styling the user interface.

JavaScript: For handling user input, fetching data from the API, and dynamically updating the UI.

Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap): For accessing up-to-date weather data for any city in the world.

📚 What I Learned

How to make HTTP requests using fetch() to access external APIs.

How to parse JSON responses and use the data in a web application.

Improved my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

Gained practical experience in debugging, error handling, and designing responsive layouts.

This project gave me a solid understanding of how to integrate APIs into frontend applications and helped me strengthen my web development fundamentals
